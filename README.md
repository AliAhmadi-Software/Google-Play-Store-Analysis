# Google Play Store Data Analysis

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for performing an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Google Play Store dataset, focusing on visualizations and data storytelling. The notebook covers data preprocessing, analysis, and insights extraction with the goal of understanding the factors that influence app popularity, ratings, and user engagement.

## Dataset

The analysis is based on a dataset of Google Play Store applications, including attributes such as:
- App Name
- Category
- Rating
- Number of Reviews
- Installs
- Size
- Price
- Content Rating
- Genres
- Last Updated
- Current Version
- Android Version

## Project Overview

The project follows these main steps:
1. **Data Loading**: Importing necessary libraries and loading the dataset.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, removing duplicates, and normalizing data types.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing various features to understand trends, distributions, and patterns.
4. **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features that add value to the analysis.
5. **Insights and Data Storytelling**: Deriving insights from the EDA results to answer key questions about app performance on the Google Play Store.
